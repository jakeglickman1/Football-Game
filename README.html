      <h2>Project Goal</h2>
      <p>
        This term’s focus is to deliver a concise, sandlot-inspired football slice that highlights decision making, crisp ball
        handling, and a welcoming presentation. Rather than chase full-season simulation, the project emphasizes one polished
        possession that demonstrates my approach to interaction design and rapid prototyping.
      </p>

        <figcaption>The prototype’s HUD, route overlays, and trenches currently showcased in the browser build.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Key Progress</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Established a lightweight browser build with consistent typography, color, and layout choices inspired by retro stadiums.</li>
        <li>Implemented route overlays, player markers, and HUD callouts so viewers immediately understand the on-field scenario.</li>
        <li>Automated a GitHub Pages deployment path, making it easy to distribute updates without manual exports.</li>
        <li>Captured the current slice through refreshed documentation, screenshots, and status notes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Is Going Well</h2>
      <p>
        The cohesive look-and-feel is resonating during check-ins, and the limited scope keeps iteration efficient. Control
        responsiveness continues to improve, and being able to point collaborators to a persistent Pages link has streamlined
        feedback.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges &amp; Lessons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scope management remains the primary challenge; every new idea competes with the guiding principle of a focused slice.</li>
        <li>SVG route visualization demanded more planning than anticipated, reinforcing the need for better pre-production sketches.</li>
        <li>Setting up the GitHub Pages pipeline required learning new workflow permissions but now supports faster reviews.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Plan for the Remainder of the Term</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Polish the passing mechanic with better feedback (power meter, catch confirmation, ball flight).</li>
        <li>Prototype at least one defensive behavior change so matchups feel dynamic instead of scripted.</li>
        <li>Add a short practice/tutorial sequence that introduces controls before the first possession.</li>
        <li>Playtest with classmates, capture reactions, and iterate on friction points they surface.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Game Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Retrobowl Sandlot is a browser-based football vignette that mixes arcade pacing with a light season loop. Mouse-aimed
        throws, minimal UI chrome, and lively receiver routes help the experience feel immediate even without a full playbook.
        Every possession is meant to stand alone as an expressive moment, yet the presentation still nods to television-style HUDs.
      </p>

      <h2>Feature Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mouse-aimed throwing</strong> that builds power with a hold-and-release mechanic so passes can arc over defenders.</li>
        <li><strong>Receiver route overlays</strong> drawn in SVG to preview WR, TE, and RB assignments before the snap.</li>
        <li><strong>Animated trenches</strong> to hint at pocket dynamics even in this minimalist slice.</li>
        <li><strong>Assignment-based defense</strong> where defenders trail receivers instead of blindly chasing the ball.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent LOS and first-down markers</strong> so situational awareness is always visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Eight-week season loop</strong> capped by semifinal and championship showdowns, with rings awarded for titles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Controls at a Glance</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Input</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Move QB / ball carrier</td>
            <td>Arrow Keys</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sprint</td>
            <td><code>Shift</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Throw</td>
            <td>Click + hold to charge, release toward the cursor</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Reset season</td>
            <td><code>R</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Season &amp; Progression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Schedule generation:</strong> opponents are chosen from a tuned pool with week-based difficulty scaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Playoffs:</strong> winning records unlock semifinal and championship rounds, rewarding trophy rings.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic branding:</strong> HUD labels and away end zones update to reflect each opponent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Project Structure</h2>
      <pre><code>index.html   # HUD markup, field layout, static assets
style.css    # Stadium aesthetic, player markers, responsive layout
script.js    # Game state, input, AI, season logic, rendering loop
README.md    # Project documentation
README.html  # Reflection + documentation page
</code></pre>

      <h2>Development Workflow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Clone or download the repository.</li>
        <li>Open <code>index.html</code> in a modern browser—no build step required.</li>
        <li>Optionally run <code>python -m http.server</code> or <code>npx serve</code> for live reload during testing.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Deployment Status</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The repo is GitHub Pages-friendly; pushing to <code>main</code> is enough to serve the prototype.</li>
        <li>Documentation and this reflection ship through automated workflows that publish <code>README.html</code>.</li>
        <li>Pages links make it easy for evaluators and peers to view progress without pulling the repo.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Roadmap Snapshot</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Diversify defensive calls (zones, blitz looks) to enrich reads.</li>
        <li>Layer in optional offensive play selection with formations and motion.</li>
        <li>Persist QB and team stats between runs for a franchise feel.</li>
        <li>Prototype touch controls so tablets and phones can participate.</li>
      </ol>

      <footer>
        The big objective is to finish the term with a confident, shareable slice of the game that tells the story of my design
        process as much as it shows gameplay.
